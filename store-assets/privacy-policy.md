**Effective Date:** December 23, 2024

## Overview
Vaizbtgads is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our browser extension handles your data.

## Local Data Storage
Vaizbtgads stores the following data locally on your device only:
- Extension settings and preferences
- Whitelist of trusted websites
- Blocking statistics (stored locally)
- Filter list preferences

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## Permissions Explained
Vaizbtgads requires certain browser permissions to function:

- **"Access your data for all websites"**: Required to analyze and block unwanted content on web pages

These permissions are used solely for content blocking functionality and not for data collection.

## Third-Party Services
